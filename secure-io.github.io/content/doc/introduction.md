Secure I/O is an open-source project that provides provable secure
authenticated encryption for I/O streams.

It provides packages for various programming languages and each package exposes
an easy-to-use and idiomatic API for encrypting and decrypting I/O operations.
However, Secure I/O is not a comprehensive cryptographic library. Instead, it
focuses on one specific problem, i.e. encrypting data streams, and solves that
in a provable secure way.

Take a look at the [FAQ](/doc/faq#why-should-i-use-secure-io) to learn more about
the limitations of classical encryption schemes.
